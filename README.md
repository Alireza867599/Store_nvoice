Report on the Code Functionality
This code provides a basic implementation of a user registration and login system combined with product inventory management and a simple invoicing system. Below is an analysis of how the code works:

1. User Registration and Login System
Features:
Register User:

Users can register by providing a username and password.
Passwords are hashed using a custom hash_password function before being stored in the hashpasswords.txt file.
The username and plaintext password are stored in users.txt for authentication purposes.
Login:

Users can log in by providing their username and password.
The system checks the credentials against those stored in users.txt.
Upon successful login, the system records the user's name and initiates the product ordering process.
2. Product Inventory Management
Features:
Add Products:

Allows the admin to add products to an inventory file (inventory.txt), including product ID, price, quantity, and name.
Remove Products:

Products can be removed by specifying their ID. The inventory is rewritten excluding the removed product.
Update Product Quantities:

Allows the admin to increase or decrease the quantity of products in the inventory.
Display Products:

Displays the current inventory details, including product ID, name, price, and quantity.
3. Invoicing System
Features:
Place Orders:

Users can purchase products by specifying the product ID and the quantity.
The inventory is updated to reflect the reduced quantity after an order.
The total cost is calculated in USD and converted to EUR using the CurrencyConverter class.
Users can optionally update the exchange rate during the order process.
Generate Invoice:

The order details (including product ID, name, quantity, total price in USD, and total price in EUR) are written to a user-specified file.
A timestamp is added to the invoice.
A record of the transaction is also stored in historyinvoices.txt.
4. Supporting Components
Classes:
User: Represents a user with a username and password.
Product: Represents a product with attributes such as ID, price, quantity, and name.
CurrencyConverter: Provides methods for converting USD to EUR and vice versa.
Inventory: Manages products in the inventory file.
File Management:
Users: Stored in users.txt.
Hashed Passwords: Stored in hashpasswords.txt.
Inventory: Managed in inventory.txt.
Invoices: Stored in user-specified files and historyinvoices.txt.
5. Code Workflow
Startup:

Prompts the admin to add products to the inventory.
Displays the current inventory.
User Authentication:

Users choose to log in, register, or exit.
If a user logs in, their session begins, allowing them to place orders.
Order Placement:

Users select products to buy by ID and specify quantities.
Inventory is updated, and invoices are generated.
Admin Management:

Admin can add or remove products and update product quantities.
6. Improvements and Recommendations
Security:

Store passwords as hashes only (avoid storing plaintext passwords in users.txt).
Implement salt for hashing to prevent brute-force attacks.
Error Handling:

Handle file access errors gracefully (e.g., if inventory.txt or users.txt is missing).
Validate user inputs to avoid crashes (e.g., entering non-numeric values for quantities or prices).
Code Readability:

Modularize the code further by separating user management, inventory management, and order processing into distinct functions or classes.
